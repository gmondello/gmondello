### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Greg. I work in Product Management and am passionate about Developer Experience and learning. I always welcome interesting conversation and enjoy making new connections, so I'd love for you to reach out.  


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about GitHub by going through the recently released [GitHub Skills](https://github.com/skills) interactive exercises.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: developer experience, product management, the New Orleans Saints

ðŸ“« You can find me on [linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/gregmondello) 

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/dude/el duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing

âš¡ Fun fact: i recently lived in Argentina for a few years where i learned spanish and played a lot of futbol. I have three kids but even more dogs :dizzy_face:
